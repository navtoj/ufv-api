However, Mrs. Giacomazzi was indeed a very wise and intelligent woman.  She always encouraged her children, grandchildren, her neighbours' children, to get as much education as they could. She felt strongly that with an education, you have marketable skills that will hold you in good stead for your lifetime.  She was always very interested in learning new things, no matter what they were.  For example, she used to keep track of the Canadian vs USA dollar, to better understand the economic impactrs.  Mrs. Giacomazzi was very skilled in cooking, gardening, sewing and crafts.  This award celecbrates both her understanding of the importance of education and her special love of cooking.",

However, their educational journeys had been quite different.  While Adrienne completed several advanced degrees and went on to become an influential professor at the University of the Fraser Valley (UFV).  Caroline did not complete high school because of a lack of support for an undiagnosed learning disability.\n\nDespite this, Caroline never lost her love for education.  She was always excited to attend a graduation and see a family member cross the stage.  Known for her sunny disposition and infectious laugh, she spent much of her time making a positive difference in her community – such as volunteering with her church’s overnight stay program for people forced to live on the streets.\n\nFor Adrienne, the perfect legacy for Caroline needed to honour her dedication to helping others improve their lives.  In memory of her sister, Adrienne established the Caroline Chan Memorial Endowment at UFV – which focuses on helping students with a disability and provides bursaries to students enrolled in a human service or social work program.\n\n“Caroline would be thrilled to see this endowment providing students with opportunities she never had,” say Adrienne. “She was such a caring and generous person, and I’m glad that her legacy will live on for future generations.”",

		"biography": "I was born and spent my childhood years in Finland.  It was a blessing to have wonderful parents who had faith in God.  Our family of eight moved to Canada on April 4th 1957 when I was 12 years old.  The first city where we lived was Sudbury Ontario, then Montreal Quebec and finally Vancouver, BC.\n\tAs the saying goes” Go west young man”.  I was 24 years of age, the first born among six siblings when I moved to Vancouver.  The rest of the family followed later.\n\tCanada’s 150th anniversary in 2017 marked 60 years since we arrived to this blessed nation.  We have very much to be thankful about.  Presently over 60 immediate and extended family members live in the greater Vancouver area.\n\tThe start in a new country was not easy.  Our father became severely ill and was hospitalized for six months in Sudbury.  Mother found a job cleaning a bakery to keep food on the table.  Crushed baked goods which mother was allowed to bring home formed a precious addition to our diet.\n\tI did what I could, and collected empty pop bottles from ditches.  Even two cents from each was a help in that situation.  Still a teenager I as hired as a caddy by the Sudbury Idylwylde Golf and Country Club.  Earning $2.00 per 18 hole circuit was much money for me in those days, I was overjoyed.\n\tAfter completing a trades program in Montreal I became a fully qualified sheet metal worker at age 21.  Being a journeyman in the trade which my father had recommended, I worked mostly in big construction projects throughout Canada and eventually ended up teaching the trade at the British Columbia Institute of Technology.  Although the wages were very good in the trade, I decided to return to school at a mature age to expand by knowledge base.  I will never forget how proud my parents were as they attended the convocation ceremonies at the University of British Columbia in 1986 when I received my BA Degree in History.\n\tSince teenage years I have been interested in photography, and in 1990 opened my photography studio at 313A Cambie Street in Vancouver.  The landscape paintings by my father obviously played a part in my inspiration to photograph nature.  The urge of becoming a landscape photographer was too strong to resist.  When I closed down the studio my status was a starving artist.  Following the interesting studio experience I concentrated on landscape photography.  I still consider that there is nothing like standing behind a camera on a tripod before sunrise.  When pristine nature is composed and captured with a postcard size plate film, the click from a cable release is the sound of ecstasy to me even after photographing landscapes for nearly half a century.\n\tTwo of my photos taken Hope BC in 1991 were made into postcards.  I was full of home.\n\tConsequently over a million postcards photographed in the greater Vancouver area have been published, and multitudes of images for local and international wall calendars.\n\tOver the years I have not lost the respect of two cent earnings I received from collecting empty pop bottles in Sudbury.  At the height of my successful years something unexpected happened.  On a photography trip to Hawaii in February 2008, I had a heart attack.\n\tBeing thankful to God for surviving the ordeal, a revolution book place in my life.\n\t“Do I want to continue accumulating material wealth selfishly, or do I want to give back to the community, share the blessings” was my question?\n\tHelping other, mainly students who need funds to continue with their educational goals was one way to help, I thought.  Even if I were to die tomorrow, I’m happy that others will be helped even in small way with the University of the Fraser Valley scholarship, I established in memory of our parents, Henrik and Alice Sorila.",

We hope it will encourage students to promote replacing territorial and religious conflict with unadulterated justice for all and equal recognition of people regardless of their identity in society- that being good neighbours might become the way of having good neighbours – that shedding enmity might protect against being a victim of enmity.  The daring hope is that students might embrace replacing living in conflict with peacefulc0-existence.\n\nPower, control and exploitation are so deeply engrained in most societies of the world they are often accepted as the norm.  UFV’s Peace Studies will be one of many small voices to challenge that norm.  It will need to be buoyed by long term commitment because it will take time for the realization to evolve that, in the modern world, territorial jurisdictions or religious institutions cannot readily remain isolated from scrutiny and accountability.  It will also take time for religions to re-evaluate imperialistic practices which have left a historic trail of human atrocities and consider instead how spiritual servitude and wellness is more achievable by loving and accepting your neighbour.\n\nOur concluding hope is that through initiatives like UFV’s Peace Studies, the good within humanity, which has been the world’s shield against the onslaughts of evil, would be bolstered to become the norm in societies where diversities of all sorts shun conflict and become friends to each other.  Such movements are not likely to be led by institutional jurisdictions but rather by individual people, and to that end we trust that UFV’s Peace Studies will contribute to a better world for all.",

He believed in community and helped establish the Columbia Valley Community Hall.  There he organized a Logger's Sports Event, attended many functions, provided maintenance and lawn mowing.  He was a great believer in working with your hands.  It was his mission to be sure that his grandchildren received training.  Two of his grandsons are in the trades, which brought him a lot of joy.

The males in the family followed their father's footsteps into the bakery and food business, and the agriculture sector.  The female members of the Van Reeuwyk family went into health care and finance.\n\nThe Van Reeuwyk Family bursary was established to assist UFV students, who have financial need as a roadblock to pursuing their educational goal and/or vocational pursuits.

We believe in cultivating an environment in which every First West employee, member and community partner - both present and future - is valued for their uniqueness and is empowered to thrive.\nCompelled by our Big Ideals and our longstanding cooperative ethos, we took our first steps as an organization in 2017 to embark on a journey actively pursuing equity, inclusion and diversity.  We challenged ourselves to begin moving beyond aspiration toward genuine commitment - of our time, our talent and our resources as an organization.\nOur commitment to equity, inclusion and diversity is ongoing, and there is much more to do.  We are striving to sharpen our awareness and our focus, actively working to educate ourselves on how we can continually be better.  The kind of systemic change we want to be part of can only be realized through a deliberate, long-term investment in relationship building backed by meaningful action.  In 2020. First West Credit Union created a new First West Indigenous Scholarship & Bursary program.  First West is pleased to provide a three-year commitment o UFV to provide a $1,000 bursary to an Indigenous student enrolled in Faculty of Business and Computing, Faculty of Arts and/or Indigenous Studies program.

Brodie also understood the value of education and knew that teaching was more than topics, facts, skills and applications - he knew there was always a \"big picture\".  Although he wasn't an educator in the formal sense, Brodie used his talent and generosity at TYCROP Trailers to coach and mentor people in the trade over the years all with what seemed like a perpetual smile and a great sense of adventure.  Brodie embodied the traits and skills of an ideal trades person and in everyway exemplified what it means to be a UFV trades alumni and program supporter.  He had a way of becoming everyone's friend and was always charitable and kind with his time.  We will miss you Brodie - you are gone but not forgotten.",

Due to the Second World War, he had to start working immediately after graduating from middle school in order to support his parents and to fund his younger brother's university education. Once peace returned to the country, his younger brother finished his education and graduated in 1949,. With help and encouragement from his younger brother, he spent three months learning all the high school mathematics, wrote and passed the entrance exam for Hunan University, and entered the Department of Civil Engineering. Eventually, he became a professor in engineering graphics where he incorporated his love for poetry into his teaching, allowing him to make the subject of descriptive geometry more enjoyable for his students.  Throughout the four decades of his teaching career, Xie Ai-Tang helped countless students overcome academic barriers, including students with only a middle school education, to finish their university education.\nXie Ai-Tang was a caring father who dedicated his life to his students and family.  He is loved and remembered by all his students as well as his children and grandchildren.  He is now resting at the Chilliwack Cemeteries on Little Mountain, located in the traditional territory of the Sto:lo people.  2022-10-03 is his 100th birth anniversary.  In honour of his memory and in honour of the Sto:lo nation, his son Robert has established this memorial annual bursary.

She loved her family, her close friends, her pets, and her horse Sox. She enjoyed riding with her sister through the many trails of Maple Ridge and successfully competed in equestrian events. She was also involved in Canadian Girls in Training (CGIT) and loved to fish at her family’s cabin at Nimpo Lake in the Chilcotin. Diagnosed with a rare and complex condition at birth, Louise’s vital spirit - inspired by her parents’ resilience and determination - helped her defy the medical consensus of the time.\nLouise began her post-secondary journey at Douglas College, earning her Psychiatric Nursing Diploma, then continued her studies for a Registered Nursing Diploma. She worked in healthcare for several years, including the Peace Arch Hospital in White Rock and Haney Intermediate Care in Maple Ridge, before returning to school to earn her Bachelor of Science in Nursing Degree from the University of Victoria. Later, Louise completed her Master of Nursing through Athabasca University.\nIn 2003, Louise moved to the Okanagan to help manage Athens Creek Lodge in Penticton. Because of her congenital heart condition, Louise could not carry a child, but she was able to realize her dream of becoming a mother when she adopted her son Jack at birth in 2004. In 2013, she married her husband Robert and also became a stepmother to Brendan.\nAs the world began to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, Louise was required to take a medical leave from work in order to preserve her own health. Louise used that time to return to her lifelong passion for education and completed a certificate in online teaching through the University of Calgary, after which she hoped to share her experience and knowledge with a new generation of health care professionals.\nTragically, just as the world was beginning to come out of the pandemic, Louise passed away from complications of her condition on May 7, 2022.\nLouise was an inspiring and courageous woman who fought for life, love, and happiness every day of her 53 years. She was a devoted and tenacious mother, wife, daughter, sister, aunt, niece, cousin, and friend. Louise was also a caring, compassionate, and accomplished professional who valued the transformative power of education.\nLouise cherished her deep roots in the Fraser Valley, and as a tribute to her dream of sharing her lived and professional experience with nursing students, her family has established this bursary. Because she endured so many health challenges while raising her child, Louise’s family would like to honour her memory by ensuring other nursing students can benefit and be inspired by her example for years to come.",
