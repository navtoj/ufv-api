He served as Dean and Vice President for 25 years before retiring in 2000.  Barbara Bate was a long serving faculty member who taught in College and Career Preparation and who worked extensively in the development of Family Literacy Programs. \nThe Dick Bate Scholarship was established at Dick's retirement through many contributions of his colleagues and friends.  Later in 2011, the endowment was renamed the Dick and Barbara Bate Endowment Scholarship, and now in 2017 it will be renamed the Dick and Barbara Bate Endowment Leadership Award, and will continue to grow through future donations by the Bate family.",

However, Mrs. Giacomazzi was indeed a very wise and intelligent woman.  She always encouraged her children, grandchildren, her neighbours' children, to get as much education as they could. She felt strongly that with an education, you have marketable skills that will hold you in good stead for your lifetime.  She was always very interested in learning new things, no matter what they were.  For example, she used to keep track of the Canadian vs USA dollar, to better understand the economic impactrs.  Mrs. Giacomazzi was very skilled in cooking, gardening, sewing and crafts.  This award celecbrates both her understanding of the importance of education and her special love of cooking.",

However, their educational journeys had been quite different.  While Adrienne completed several advanced degrees and went on to become an influential professor at the University of the Fraser Valley (UFV).  Caroline did not complete high school because of a lack of support for an undiagnosed learning disability.\n\nDespite this, Caroline never lost her love for education.  She was always excited to attend a graduation and see a family member cross the stage.  Known for her sunny disposition and infectious laugh, she spent much of her time making a positive difference in her community – such as volunteering with her church’s overnight stay program for people forced to live on the streets.\n\nFor Adrienne, the perfect legacy for Caroline needed to honour her dedication to helping others improve their lives.  In memory of her sister, Adrienne established the Caroline Chan Memorial Endowment at UFV – which focuses on helping students with a disability and provides bursaries to students enrolled in a human service or social work program.\n\n“Caroline would be thrilled to see this endowment providing students with opportunities she never had,” say Adrienne. “She was such a caring and generous person, and I’m glad that her legacy will live on for future generations.” \n",

Abebe was a model of self-determination, a value held highly in social work.  He had completed his doctoral studies in less than three years; he was fluent in seven languages; he was a poet, a musician, and a philosopher.  Abebe had overcome high obstacles in his life.  He was blinded at nine years of age due to smallpox.  He was tortured and imprisoned for over a year.  He fled his home in Ethiopia in 1985, leaving a teaching position, and walked about 2100 km to Sudan to escape the brutality of the military junta, the Dergue.  Peace, harmony, and respect for human rights is a legacy that Abebe Abay Teklu lived and died by.  He was a man filled with Grace.  He \"walked his talk\".  The Dr. Abebe Abay Teklu Leadership Award is grounded in the African philosophy of Ubuntu which focuses on the allegiances and interconnectedness of all peoples.",

				"label": "Biography:",
				"value": "      I was born and spent my childhood years in Finland.  It was a blessing to have wonderful parents who had faith in God.  Our family of eight moved to Canada on April 4th 1957 when I was 12 years old.  The first city where we lived was Sudbury Ontario, then Montreal Quebec and finally Vancouver, BC.\n\tAs the saying goes” Go west young man”.  I was 24 years of age, the first born among six siblings when I moved to Vancouver.  The rest of the family followed later.\n\tCanada’s 150th anniversary in 2017 marked 60 years since we arrived to this blessed nation.  We have very much to be thankful about.  Presently over 60 immediate and extended family members live in the greater Vancouver area.\n\tThe start in a new country was not easy.  Our father became severely ill and was hospitalized for six months in Sudbury.  Mother found a job cleaning a bakery to keep food on the table.  Crushed baked goods which mother was allowed to bring home formed a precious addition to our diet.\n\tI did what I could, and collected empty pop bottles from ditches.  Even two cents from each was a help in that situation.  Still a teenager I as hired as a caddy by the Sudbury Idylwylde Golf and Country Club.  Earning $2.00 per 18 hole circuit was much money for me in those days, I was overjoyed.\n\tAfter completing a trades program in Montreal I became a fully qualified sheet metal worker at age 21.  Being a journeyman in the trade which my father had recommended, I worked mostly in big construction projects throughout Canada and eventually ended up teaching the trade at the British Columbia Institute of Technology.  Although the wages were very good in the trade, I decided to return to school at a mature age to expand by knowledge base.  I will never forget how proud my parents were as they attended the convocation ceremonies at the University of British Columbia in 1986 when I received my BA Degree in History.\n\tSince teenage years I have been interested in photography, and in 1990 opened my photography studio at 313A Cambie Street in Vancouver.  The landscape paintings by my father obviously played a part in my inspiration to photograph nature.  The urge of becoming a landscape photographer was too strong to resist.  When I closed down the studio my status was a starving artist.  Following the interesting studio experience I concentrated on landscape photography.  I still consider that there is nothing like standing behind a camera on a tripod before sunrise.  When pristine nature is composed and captured with a postcard size plate film, the click from a cable release is the sound of ecstasy to me even after photographing landscapes for nearly half a century.\n\tTwo of my photos taken Hope BC in 1991 were made into postcards.  I was full of home.\n\tConsequently over a million postcards photographed in the greater Vancouver area have been published, and multitudes of images for local and international wall calendars.\n\tOver the years I have not lost the respect of two cent earnings I received from collecting empty pop bottles in Sudbury.  At the height of my successful years something unexpected happened.  On a photography trip to Hawaii in February 2008, I had a heart attack.\n\tBeing thankful to God for surviving the ordeal, a revolution book place in my life.\n\t“Do I want to continue accumulating material wealth selfishly, or do I want to give back to the community, share the blessings” was my question?\n\tHelping other, mainly students who need funds to continue with their educational goals was one way to help, I thought.  Even if I were to die tomorrow, I’m happy that others will be helped even in small way with the University of the Fraser Valley scholarship, I established in memory of our parents, Henrik and Alice Sorila.\n\t\n",

We hope it will encourage students to promote replacing territorial and religious conflict with unadulterated justice for all and equal recognition of people regardless of their identity in society- that being good neighbours might become the way of having good neighbours – that shedding enmity might protect against being a victim of enmity.  The daring hope is that students might embrace replacing living in conflict with peacefulc0-existence.\n\nPower, control and exploitation are so deeply engrained in most societies of the world they are often accepted as the norm.  UFV’s Peace Studies will be one of many small voices to challenge that norm.  It will need to be buoyed by long term commitment because it will take time for the realization to evolve that, in the modern world, territorial jurisdictions or religious institutions cannot readily remain isolated from scrutiny and accountability.  It will also take time for religions to re-evaluate imperialistic practices which have left a historic trail of human atrocities and consider instead how spiritual servitude and wellness is more achievable by loving and accepting your neighbour.\n\nOur concluding hope is that through initiatives like UFV’s Peace Studies, the good within humanity, which has been the world’s shield against the onslaughts of evil, would be bolstered to become the norm in societies where diversities of all sorts shun conflict and become friends to each other.  Such movements are not likely to be led by institutional jurisdictions but rather by individual people, and to that end we trust that UFV’s Peace Studies will contribute to a better world for all. \n",

He was always eager to get the job done; there was no task he would not tackle.  Even at the age of 80, he was crawling under a house to wire in a new laundry room.  He believed in community and helped establish the Columbia Valley Community Hall.  There he organized a Logger's Sports Event, attended many functions, provided maintenance and lawn mowing.  He was a great believer in working with your hands.  It was his mission to be sure that his grandchildren received training.  Two of his grandsons are in the trades, which brought him a lot of joy.  For that reason, we are setting up this Bursary in honor of him.",

In 1987 the Esposito Family opened its primary hospitality business in Abbotsford called King’s Crossing Social Centre which included a banquet facility and the original Finnegan’s Pub (also known as Building “F”).  King’s Crossing was located adjacent to UFV (formerly UCFV) and so began the great relationship between neighbours.  Over the years, the Esposito Family enjoyed serving all the amazing people associated with UFV including the students, faculty, workers (love you Kartar, Paul & the gang), administration and visitors.  Further, the Esposito Family was privileged to employ so many UFV students which greatly contributed to our success and theirs.\n\nThese bursary awards are the Esposito Family’s way of say THANK YOU to our neighbours at UFV for their support and friendship.  Further, having witnessed firsthand the dedication it takes for a student to work while attending post-secondary, these bursaries are intended to recognize and reward UFV students seeking a post-secondary education/trade skill while continuing to positively contribute in the workplace.  Additionally, we trust it will relieve a bit of financial pressure for the recipients and provide encouragement to achieve excellence in their journey of life.  We wish to great success and encourage you to apply! -  The Esposito Family \n\n",

Leadership has been at the heart of the Esposito Family’s ability to overcome challenges and find success from immigrating to Canada from Italy in the early 1950’s with no more than some old clothes to developing several successful businesses in Abbotsford.  With positive leadership comes the ability to find solutions, develop a plan, unite people together, and take action to achieve success for the betterment of the team.  If this is something you have accomplished within your own families, as a member of a sports team, at school, volunteering in your community, at your place of work or in another aspect of your life then we say “THANK YOU” and hope you will share your positive leadership experience and apply for our leadership award.  We wish you great success in your journey of life!\n\n“If you do nothing expect nothing.  If you do something then success and advancement becomes a possibility.

Having limited financial resources and virtually no ability to speak the English language initially, over the years the family grew to become productive citizens of society.  The males in the family followed their father's footsteps into the bakery and food business, and the agriculture sector.  The female members of the Van Reeuwyk family went into health care and finance.\n\nThe Van Reeuwyk Family bursary was established to assist UFV students, who have financial need as a roadblock to pursuing their educational goal and/or vocational pursuits.  This bursary will assist an applicant to move forwards the reality of their educational dreams.",

Many of these students credited him for his support, mentorship, and showing them new pathways for their academic and professional careers.\n\nThis endowment is set up in Tony’s memory by his sister Adrienne.

We also believe that community-based organizations like First West have an opportunity to contribute to creating a more equitable, inclusive and diverse future for everyone.  We believe in cultivating an environment in which every First West employee, member and community partner - both present and future - is valued for their uniqueness and is empowered to thrive.\nCompelled by our Big Ideals and our longstanding cooperative ethos, we took our first steps as an organization in 2017 to embark on a journey actively pursuing equity, inclusion and diversity.  We challenged ourselves to begin moving beyond aspiration toward genuine commitment - of our time, our talent and our resources as an organization.\nOur commitment to equity, inclusion and diversity is ongoing, and there is much more to do.  We are striving to sharpen our awareness and our focus, actively working to educate ourselves on how we can continually be better.  The kind of systemic change we want to be part of can only be realized through a deliberate, long-term investment in relationship building backed by meaningful action.  In 2020. First West Credit Union created a new First West Indigenous Scholarship & Bursary program.  First West is pleased to provide a three-year commitment o UFV to provide a $1,000 bursary to an Indigenous student enrolled in Faculty of Professional Studies program.  In alignment with First West Credit Union's EDI Commitment, First West continues to develop partnerships with local universities to encourage members of underrepresented groups to apply and join their organization.",

Weston loved life and found beauty in almost everything.  He would constantly point out sunsets, flowers, cars and trucks, and mountains to anyone who was near.\n\nWeston was an outgoing, happy, passionate, kind, goofy, and smart kid who loved being in nature and looking at trees and plants and animals around him.  He wanted to be an architect, a construction worker, a mechanic, and an artist when he grew up.\n\nWeston's mom Mallory has worked at UFV since 2016 and Weston spent many days running around the campus and playing with LEGO in the Student Life Lounge.  Weston's family is so grateful to everyone who donated to their GoFundMe which made this Award possible.\n\nWeston was and will always be so loved by his mom, dad, and sister and is missed every moment of every day.\n",

Brodie also understood the value of education and knew that teaching was more than topics, facts, skills and applications - he knew there was always a \"big picture\".  Although he wasn't an educator in the formal sense, Brodie used his talent and generosity at TYCROP Trailers to coach and mentor people in the trade over the years all with what seemed like a perpetual smile and a great sense of adventure.  Brodie embodied the traits and skills of an ideal trades person and in everyway exemplified what it means to be a UFV trades alumni and program supporter.  He had a way of becoming everyone's friend and was always charitable and kind with his time.  We will miss you Brodie - you are gone but not forgotten.",

Due to the Second World War, he had to start working immediately after graduating from middle school in order to support his parents and to fund his younger brother's university education. Once peace returned to the country, his younger brother finished his education and graduated in 1949,. With help and encouragement from his younger brother, he spent three months learning all the high school mathematics, wrote and passed the entrance exam for Hunan University, and entered the Department of Civil Engineering. Eventually, he became a professor in engineering graphics where he incorporated his love for poetry into his teaching, allowing him to make the subject of descriptive geometry more enjoyable for his students.  Throughout the four decades of his teaching career, Xie Ai-Tang helped countless students overcome academic barriers, including students with only a middle school education, to finish their university education.\nXie Ai-Tang was a caring father who dedicated his life to his students and family.  He is loved and remembered by all his students as well as his children and grandchildren.  He is now resting at the Chilliwack Cemeteries on Little Mountain, located in the traditional territory of the Sto:lo people.  2022-10-03 is his 100th birth anniversary.  In honour of his memory and in honour of the Sto:lo nation, his son Robert has established this memorial annual bursary.  We hope that his story, his spirit of courage, and his care and love will be a source of encouragement to you, the students.",

On May 16, 2022, Liam died alone in his apartment of an accidental fentanyl poisoning.  Death due to drugs is most common in men, especially those working in the trades.  His death was unintentional, and a devastating loss to all who knew him.\nLiam was creative, hardworking, quick thinking, witty, and smart.  He had many creative endeavours: jewelry and stained glass making; rap usic; and of course, welding.  He loved his motorcycle, cats, and tarantula.  He enjoyed spending time gaming with friends and connecting with his family.\nLiam worked for a small business in Abbotsford repairing farm equipment, building gates and fences, and generally finding welding solutions.  He had plans to one day open his own shop. While Liam struggled financially and at times, emotionally, he was finding his way.\nOur family hopes to remember Liam and honour his memory with this award.  We hope it will help someone who may have their own personal struggles but is as hard working and dedicated to the welding profession as Liam was.",
